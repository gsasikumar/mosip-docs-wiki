Providing unique identity for an individual is one of key features of MOSIP platform. To do this MOSIP will 

- Use biometric information (finger print and Iris only) of an individual
- Leverage Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS)
- Design for integrating with multiple ABIS providers and take the best result
- Not use ABIS for authentication (deduplication only)

This document will provide the specification an ABIS provider must implement to meet MOSIP's requirements.

# Overview
![](_images/arch_diagrams/ABIS_middleware.png)

- MOSIP will interact with ABIS only via message queues
- JSON format will be used to interact with ABIS

Biometric data sent to ABIS will follow the below standards.
- CBEFF: ISO/IEC 19785-3
- Fingerprints: ISO/IEC 19794-2, ISO/IEC 19794-4
- IRIS: ISO/IEC 19794-6
- Face: ISO/IEC 19794-5

ABIS should support the following types of biometric images
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (4-4-2), or 
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (4-1-4-1), or
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (2-2-2-2-2), or 
- Individual fingerprint images (segmented)
- IRIS images (Left, and Right)
- Face photograph

ABIS should support the following requests

## Key terminologies
### ABIS
Automated Biometric Identification System whose primary responsibility is de-duplication of biometric data (finger print & Iris).
