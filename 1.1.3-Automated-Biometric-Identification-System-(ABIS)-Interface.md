Providing unique identity for an individual is one of key features of MOSIP platform. To do this MOSIP will 

- Use biometric information (finger print and Iris only) of an individual
- Leverage Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS)
- Design for integrating with multiple ABIS providers and take the best result
- Not use ABIS for authentication (deduplication only)

This document will provide the specification an ABIS provider must implement to meet MOSIP's requirements.
