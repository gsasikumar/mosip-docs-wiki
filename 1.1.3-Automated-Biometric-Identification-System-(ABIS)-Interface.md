Providing unique identity for an individual is one of key features of MOSIP platform. To do this MOSIP will 

- Use biometric information (finger print and Iris only) of an individual
- Leverage Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS)
- Design for integrating with multiple ABIS providers and take the best result
- Not use ABIS for authentication (deduplication only)

This document will provide the specification an ABIS provider must implement to meet MOSIP's requirements.

# Overview
![](_images/arch_diagrams/ABIS_middleware.png)

- MOSIP will interact with ABIS only via message queues
- JSON format will be used to interact with ABIS

Biometric data sent to ABIS will follow the below standards.
- CBEFF: ISO/IEC 19785-3
- Fingerprints: ISO/IEC 19794-2, ISO/IEC 19794-4
- IRIS: ISO/IEC 19794-6
- Face: ISO/IEC 19794-5

ABIS should support the following types of biometric images
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (4-4-2), or 
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (4-1-4-1), or
- Unsegmented fingerprint images (2-2-2-2-2), or 
- Individual fingerprint images (segmented)
- IRIS images (Left, and Right)
- Face photograph

ABIS should support the following requests

Management | Registration
-----------|-------------
Shutdown   | Insert
Clear      | Identify
Ping       | Verify
GetPendingRequests | Delete
GetReferenceCounts | Ping
Configure

## Key terminologies
### ABIS
Automated Biometric Identification System whose primary responsibility is de-duplication of biometric data (finger print & Iris).

### Candidate list
Each Identify request to ABIS can return zero or more records that match the provided biometric data. The returned records is referred to as the candidate list

### Reference Database
The database maintained with the ABIS system which stores the biometrics data of an individual

### Gallery
A subset of the population in the Reference Database used as a target to search for a specific entry. ABIS should have a provision to take an Identify or Verify request with a target gallery parameter

### Master Database
The database within MOSIP which contains the ID details (demographic & biometric) of an Individual. This database is not related to Reference Database.

### TargetFMR
FMR is False Match Rate. This is the rate at which non-matched requests return a match request (a false positive). An ABIS should be able to send the FMR as defined below.
FMR is an integer which should be calculated as per this formula
```
round (-10 * log10 (target FMR))

The acceptable values are
Target False Match Rate | score
------------------------|------
1 in 1,000               | 30
1 in 10,000              | 40
1 in 100,000            | 50
