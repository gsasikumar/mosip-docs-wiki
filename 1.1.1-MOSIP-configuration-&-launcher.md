MOSIP as a platform will have multiple applications running and each application will have a set of configurations. The section details 
1. The key configuration files a system owner has to create before starting the platform
2. Launcher component which will read the configuration files, validate and launch the platform

# MOSIP Configuration
MOSIP platform will have two key configuration files
- MOSIP ID definition (mosip_id_definition.xml)
- MOSIP platform config (mosip_platform_config.xml)

### MOSIP ID definition
MOSIP ID definition configuration will define what attributes of an ID can be captured. Creating this configuration will be the first step for a system owner.
MOSIP will define the base set of attributes for an ID. A system owner can choose the subset required from this base set.

Please refer to the base ID definition xml @ https://github.com/mosip/mosip/blob/DEV/config/master_id_definition.xml

The below snippet of XML shows how a system owner wants to represent Name

       <name required="yes">
		<firstname required="yes" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<givenname required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<middlename required="yes" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<middleinitial required="no" type="string" maxlength="3"/>
		<lastname required="yes" type="string" mexlength="15"/>		
		<surname required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<forename required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
	</name>

The list of elements under the "name" element is the base set that MOSIP will support. A system owner can choose "firstname", "middlename" and "lastname" as required elements to be captured. The system owner can also define the validation rules like maxlength.

### MOSIP platform config
MOSIP platform config is the file a system owner will create that controls which features are available and which ones are not. For example, in Pre-Registration module, a system owner may not wish to have booking feature and would like the users to just pre-register by giving demo details, then come to a registration center, take a token and wait in queue for registration.

Please refer to the MOSIP platform config XML @ https://github.com/mosip/mosip/blob/DEV/config/mosip_platform_config.xml

The below XML snippet shows a sample configuration

              <module id="Registration"
			description="This module helps registration Officers to enrol people for a digital ID">
			<component id="registration">
				<features>
					<feature id="demo_data_capture">
					</feature>
					<feature id="poa_doc_upload" />
					<feature id="poi_doc_upload" />
					<feature id="fingerprint_capture" required="no" />
					<feature id="iris_capture" required="yes" />
				</features>
			</component>
			<component id="data_sync">
				<features>
					<feature id="pre_registration_data_sync" />
					<feature id="master_data_sync" />
				</features>
			</component>
			<component id="id_object_upload">
				<features>
					<feature id="object_creator" />
					<feature id="object_uploader" />
				</features>
			</component>
		</module>

### MOSIP Config server
MOSIP will have a centralized config server where all the configuration elements will go including the above two configs. MOSIP will use spring cloud config to implement the config server. All the config files will be version controlled in git and the config server will fetch the config values from a git url. Different sets of configurations can be created based on the environment. One set for Pre-Prod and one for Prod etc. so that system administrators need not change the values on the same set of files.
