MOSIP as a platform will have multiple applications running and each application will have a set of configurations. The section details 
1. The key configuration files a system owner has to create before starting the platform
2. Launcher component which will read the configuration files, validate and launch the platform

# MOSIP Configuration
MOSIP platform will have two key configuration files
- MOSIP ID definition (mosip_id_definition.xml)
- MOSIP platform config (mosip_platform_config.xml)

### MOSIP ID definition
MOSIP ID definition configuration will define what attributes of an ID can be captured. Creating this configuration will be the first step for a system owner.
MOSIP will define the base set of attributes for an ID. A system owner can choose the subset required from this base set.

Please refer to the base ID definition xml @ https://github.com/mosip/mosip/blob/DEV/config/master_id_definition.xml

The below snippet of XML shows how a system owner wants to represent Name

       <name required="yes">
		<firstname required="yes" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<givenname required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<middlename required="yes" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<middleinitial required="no" type="string" maxlength="3"/>
		<lastname required="yes" type="string" mexlength="15"/>		
		<surname required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
		<forename required="no" type="string" maxlength="15"/>
	</name>

The list of elements under the "name" element is the base set that MOSIP will support. A system owner can choose "firstname", "middlename" and "lastname" as required elements to be captured. The system owner can also define the validation rules like maxlength.
