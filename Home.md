MOSIP acronym for Modular Open Source Identity Platform helps governments of countries to build a digital identity system. Using this, every Individual of a country can be given a Unique Identity Number (UIN). This helps in inclusivity and accessibility of all Individuals without disparity or discrimination.

MOSIP provides the following basic features 
- acquire an Individual's identity data
- process the identity data to establish uniqueness
- generate a Unique Identity Number
- verify/authenticate an Individual's identity where required to provide access to services (for example, opening a bank 
  account; providing healthcare insurance; provide government subsidized food etc.)

The key objectives of the platform are to
- provide the basic framework to create a fully functional identity system
- provide the flexibility for a country to choose the modules of the basic framework as per their requirements
- provide the flexibility for a country to choose the identity attributes to be acquired as per the countries legal framework
- maintain privacy, security and confidentiality of an Individual's data
- provide a scalable and accessible solution to cater to a wide range of population (a few thousands to tens of millions)
