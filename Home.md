The Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) helps Governments and other user organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system in a cost effective way. Nations can use MOSIP freely to build their own identity systems. Being modular in its architecture, MOSIP provides flexibility to countries in how they implement and configure their systems, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.

MOSIP provides the following basic features 
* acquire an Individual's identity data
* process the identity data to establish uniqueness
* generate a Unique Identity Number
* verify/authenticate an Individual's identity where required to provide access to services (for example, providing 
  healthcare insurance to the poorest in the society; provide government subsidized food for the needy; include children 
  from the poorest and remote communities into the education system etc.)

The key objectives of the platform are to
* provide the basic framework to create a fully functional identity system
* provide the flexibility for a country to choose the features from the basic framework as per their requirements
* maintain privacy, security and confidentiality of an Individual's data
* provide a scalable and accessible solution to cater to a wide range of population (a few thousands to tens of millions)

# MOSIP Platform Documentation

The Platform Documentation has everything that you need in terms of requirements, architecture, functional view and APIs.
The document can be accessed [here](../../wiki/Platform-Documentation).

We encourage you to first get an [overview](../..//wiki) of the MOSIP project and its [principles and architectural goals](../../wiki/Architecture-Principles-&-Platform-Goals).

The [logical architecture](../../wiki/Logical-Architecture) covers the key design aspects.

The [technology stack](../../wiki/Technology-Stack) lists some of the key technologies used in MOSIP.
