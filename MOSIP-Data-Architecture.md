This section covers high-level data architecture standards of MOSIP.

* MOSIP is developed on a open source data platform. 
* Chosen data platform is free and open source. 
* Chosen data platform can be replaced with another equivalent component with help of abstraction components
* Software and technology stack doesnâ€™t mandate any specific vendor

Below diagram provides the data architecture of MOSIP system

TBD
