A country may use one or more ABIS's to de-duplicate biometric data. The reason for using multiple ABIS's could be
- Use one ABIS for fingerprint and another for Iris
- Use multiple ABIS's for the same biometric data and evaluate the best ABIS based on the de-duplication (However, MOSIP ABIS middleware will not have any logic to evaluate the best ABIS)

MOSIP ABIS middleware will have the following components
- MOSIP ABIS request handler 
- Request router (based on routing policy, an ABIS request is routed to the correct ABIS system)
- ABIS response handler
