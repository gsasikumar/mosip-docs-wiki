# Audit Manager
Audits are events/transactions which need to be captured and stored to facilitate auditing. This data could further be used for reporting by the business.

This includes auditing various event types like System events (Periodic scans), Business events/transactions (Change in demo data), Security Events etc.

The Audit Manager component will receive a request to audit and store data, validate the request is from an authorized source, securely store the requested data and respond back with an acknowledgement of storage (Success/Failure). This component will also ensure non-auditable data is not stored.

It will also ensure audit data stored is archived based on the defined archival policy.
