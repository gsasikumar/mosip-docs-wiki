Each ID generated for an Individual is uniquely identified by the UIN (Unique Identification Number). This is a central API which all other modules of MOSIP will use to retrieve an ID record.

This API will support the following features
 - Creation of a ID record
 - Lookup of an ID record based on the UIN
 - Will not support search based on attributes of an ID
