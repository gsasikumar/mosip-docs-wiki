### Deployment Checklist
This checklist should be verified once the environment is ready, and before it can be consumed.

Deployment checklist is divided into 2 parts - 
 1. `Infrastructure Checklist` – This checklist lists the required installations for all the modules.
 2. `Application Checklist` – This checklist lists the dependent services, configurations, required roles, any explicit permissions, etc. for all the modules.
