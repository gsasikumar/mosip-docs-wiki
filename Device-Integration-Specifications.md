# Device Integration approach:

This document detailed out the design approach to integrate with the list of devices used in the MOSIP platform.

Interface approach has been taken to implement the integration with external devices. The interface should have the required method to communicate with the external devices. The respective device vendor's specific implementation class should implement the methods using vendor provided libraries. An Abstract class also been defined to provide the common utility feature required at device level irrespective of vendor based implementation.

## Devices:
1. Scanner
2. Printer
3. Web Camera
4. GPS
