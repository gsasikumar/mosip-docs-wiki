**Registration Client - Installation and Configuration:** 
***

This document contains the 'Registration client (Reg Client App)' application initial setup, update and configuration process.       

Registration Client application is a desktop based application, that can be used to captures the Demographic and Biometric details of an Individual along with supporting information (proof documents & information about parent /guardian /introducer) and packages the information in a secure way using RSA based algorithm. The information packet can be sent to the server in an online or offline mode for processing.  

The Registration client application leverages the TPM capabilities and secure the data and mark the senders identity in the request before sending to external system. The MOSIP server would validate the request and make sure that the request received from the right source. Every individual machine's TPM public key should be registered at MOSIP server to accept and process the data send by them.   

A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specialized chip on a local machines that stores RSA encryption keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication. Each TPM chip contains an RSA key pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The pair is maintained inside the chip and cannot be accessed by software. By leveraging this security feature every individual machine would be uniquely registered and identified by the MOSIP server component.

**Application Build:**  
***  
   JDK 8u181 [Oracle] or later version to Build the application.  
   **Registration client application is build with four different modules.**     
     registration-client - it contains only UI related code.  
     registration-libs - it contains the code to generate the initial run.bat.   
     registration-mdm-service - Mosip Device Manager service to integrate with BIO device and render the required data in standard format and that will be consumed by the 'registration-services' module.   
     registration-services - it contains the Java API, which would be called from UI module to render the services to the User and capture the detail from User and store it in db or send to external systems through services.    

   **Following files to be modified before build the application:**  
       mosip-application.properties - [registration-libs module] - Contains the environment variable.  
       spring-<env>.properties - [registration-services module] - It contains the environment based REST client url to make different service calls.       

	Post completion of above mentioned changes, build 'mosip-parent' pom.xml file to build the application.

        Make sure that 'maven-metadata.xml' is generated under the '**registration-client**' module, 
        post successful build generation. Which is referred by the reg-client application to download the required jars 
        based on the version.

        Post-build process 'META-INF.MF' file also should be present in the JFROG repository, which consists of the 
        jar files checksum.

    6.	LocalIPAddress aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd(Line 131)  change to our machine IP address   

   **Once all the Configurations are done run the freshclam.exe and then run clamd.exe. If required, restart the machine.**   
 
**Registration Client installation:**   
***  
**Download - Application Initial Setup file:**  
   
   1. User login to the JFROG artifactory portal and download the client application initial setup ZIP file [mosip-sw-0.12.*.zip].   
   2. Once downloaded then unzip the file into a particular location. It contains the following folder structure.  
      - bin : It contains the client UI and service binaries in encrypted format.
      - lib : It contains the library required for the application to run.  
      - props : It contains the property file that will be used by application.    
      - cer  : It contains the certificate used to communicate with the MOSIP server.  
      - db : It contains the encrypted derby database.   
      - run.bat : batch file to launch the application.  
      - jre : It contains the java runtime engine along with the required dlls. 
      
   3. Click the 'run.bat' to initiate the setup process.  
   
   When user clicks on the 'run.bat' it does the following :  
   1. Loads the binary repository URL from property file.  
   2. Communicate with the  JFrog repository through secured connection and download the maven-metadata.xml file to identify the latest jar versions.    
   3. Download the latest build Manifest.mf file from server, where all the jars (including shared lib) name and checksums are provided.  
   4. Compare the checksum of local version of jar files with the data present in latest downloaded Manifest.mf file.    
   5. Identify the list of binary files and Download the required jars.  
   6. Once download completed then communicate with TPM to decrypt the key{if TPM enabled}, which is used to decrypt the UI and service jars and start the application.   
   
**Application Startup:**  
   - User should initially be online to validate their authentication against the MOSIP server. Post which, the sync process would be initiated.     
   - Once the sync process completed then restart the application to pick the local configuration.  
   - User should perform the self onboarding before start using the application.  


**Update Process:**
***
   The application refers to the 'maven-metadata.xml' to verifies any new version exists or not. [Which is generated under 
   the '**registration-client**' module post successful Jenkins build.]
   
   mosip.rollback.path - Make sure that rollback path is provided in this variable, which is available in 'mosip-application.properties' file. 
       
   **Application update:**
   - During the startup of the application, the software check will be validating against the maven-metadata.xml file from artifactory repository. If any diffs found, application prompts the user with 'Update Now' or 'Update Later' options to install immediately or later. Apart from this there is another menu option available in the application to trigger the 'Update' process post login to the application. The update process would update both the application binaries and DB.
    
   - During update process, the running application refer the 'rollback' path and take the back up of 'lib, bin, MANIFEST.MF' files inside rollback folder with new folder as 'Version_timstamp' format. 
   - Download and Update the required binary libraries and db script into the existing running folder and restart the application.  
        
   **Database update:**  
   - The database update can be rolled out through the binary update process. If any changes in the script then the respective script would be attached inside 'registration-service/resource/sql/version folder [like: 0.12.8]' and deliver the jar with newer version. During update process the jar would be downloaded and script inside the jar would be executed.  It would also contains the 'rollback' {registration-service/resource/sql/version folder_rollback [like: 0.12.8_rollback]} script if update process to be rollbacked due to any technical error.  


**Configuration:**  
***
   Application provided with the facility of multiple configurations for different set of parameters. Each attribute level configuration changes should be performed at 'Config' server and same should be sync to the local machine through kernel services.  Here few of the configurations are listed out that provide the facility to enable and disable the biometric.
