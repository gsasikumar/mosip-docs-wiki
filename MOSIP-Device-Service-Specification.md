ISO/IEC 19785-3:2015

[http://docs.oasis-open.org/bioserv/BIAS/v2.0/csprd01/schemas/cbeff_ed2.xsd](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bioserv/BIAS/v2.0/csprd01/schemas/cbeff_ed2.xsd)

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use in registration and authentication scenarios.

### Device Trust

MOSIP compliant devices provide a trust environment for the devices to be used in registration, KYC and auth scenarios. The trust level is established based on the device support for trusted execution.

**Foundational Device Trust Module:**

The foundational device trust module would be created using a secure microprocessor capable of performing all required biometric processing and secure storage of keys. The foundational device trust would satisfy the below requirements.

1. The module has the ability to store/generate and process cryptographic keys.
2. Hardware based generation of asymmetric keys.
3. The module has the ability to protect keys from extraction.
4. The module has to protect the keys from physical tampering, temperature, frequency and voltage related attacks.
5. The module has the ability to perform a secure boot.
6. The module has the ability to run trusted applications.

The foundational device trust is derived from this module is used to enable trust-based computing for biometric capture.

The foundational device trust module provides for a trusted execution environment based on the following.

1. Secure Boot
    1. Ability to cryptographically verify code before execution.
    2. Ability to check for integrity violation of the module/device
    3. Halt upon failure.
1. Secure application
    1. Ability to run applications that are trusted.
    2. Protect against downgrading of applications.

**Foundational Trust Module Identity:**

The foundational module upon its first boot is expected to generate a random asymmetric key pair and provide the public part of the key to obtain a valid certificate. The entire certificate issuance would be in a secured provisioning facility. The certificate issued to the module will have a defined validity period as per the MOSIP certificate policy document.

**Device Identity:**


As MOSIP deals with biometrics it is imperative that all devices that connect to MOSIP are identifiable. MOSIP believes in cryptographic Identity as its basis for trust.


**Physical ID:** An identification mark that shows MOSIP compliance and a readable unique device serial number (12 digit), make and model. The same information has to be available over a 2D QR Code or Barcode.


**Digital ID:** A digital device id in MOSIP would be a signed JSON as follows:

```
{
    “serialNo”: “<serial_no>”,


    “make”: “<make>”,


    “model” : “<Model of the device>”,


    “type”: [“Fingerprint”, “Slab Fingerprint”, “Iris”, “Face’’], //More types will be added.


    “dp”: “<device provider name>”,


    “dpId”: “<device provider id>”,


    “dateTime”: “<datetime>” // ISO format with timezone.  Identity request time


}
```

Signed with the JSON Web Signature using the “Foundational Trust Module” Identity key, this data is the fundamental identity of the device.  Every MOSIP compliant device will need the foundational trust module.

**Accepted Values**:

```
    serialNo - Same as the Physical ID


    make - Brand name


    model - Model of the device


    type - [“Fingerprint”, “Slab Fingerprint”, “Iris”, “Face’’], //More types will be added.


    dp - Device provider name, This would be a legal entity in the country,


    dpId: Device provider id issued by MOSIP

dateTime:  ISO format with timezone.  Identity request time \

```
### Device Service - Communication Interfaces

The section explains the necessary details of the biometric device connectivity, accessibility, discoverability and protocols used to build and communicate with the device.

The device should implement only the following set of APIs.  All the API’s are independent of the physical layer and the operating system, with the invocation being different across operating systems. While the operating system names are defined in this spec a similar technology can be used for unspecified operating systems.

It is expected that the device service ensures that the device is connected  locally to the host.


**Specifications for Windows and Linux**

#### Device Discovery:

Device discovery would be used to identify MOSIP compliant devices in a system by the applications. The protocol is designed as simple plug and play with all the necessary abstraction to the specifics.

Discovery Request:

**Request:**

```
{


“type”: “<type of the device>”


}

```
**Accepted Values **
```

type: “Biometric Device”, “Fingerprint”, “Face”, “Iris”


Note: “Biometric Device” - is a special type and used in case if you are looking for any biometric device.

```
**Response:**

```
[


{

“type”: “<exact type>”,


“deviceId”: “<internal id>”,


“subType”: “<subtypes of the biometric device>”,


“deviceStatus”: “<device status>”,


“certification”: “<certification level>”,


“serviceVersion”: “<device service version>”,


“deviceSubId”: “<device sub id’s>”,


“callbackId”: “<how to reach to the device>“,


"error": {


"errorcode": "101",


"errorinfo": "Invalid JSON Value Type For Discovery.. ex: {type: “Biometric Device” or “Fingerprint” or “Face” or “Iris” or “Vein”} "


}


}


]
```

**Accepted values:**
```

type - “Finger”, “Face”, ”Iris”


subType - subtype is based on the type.


	Finger - “Slab”, “Single”, “Touchless”


                Iris - “Single”, “Double”,


               Face - Full face


deviceStatus - “Active”, “Inactive”


certification - “L0”, “L1” - Level of certification


serviceVersion - Version of the MDS specification that is supported.


deviceId - Internal Id to identify the actual biometric device within the device service.


deviceSubId - is the internal id of the device. For example in case of iris capture, the device can have two modules in a single device, it is possible to address each device with a sub id so we can identify or command each of it in isolation. Sub id is a simple index which always starts with 1 and increases sequentially for each sub device present.


callbackId - this differs as per the OS. In case of linux and windows operating systems it is a http url. In the case of android, it is the intent name. In IOS it is the url scheme. The call back url takes precedence over future request as a base url.

```
Note: The response is an array that we could have a single device enumerating with multiple biometric options.


Note: The service should ensure to respond only if the type parameter matches the type of device or the type parameter is a “Biometric Device”.

**Windows/Linux:**
All the device API will be based on the HTTP specification. The device always binds to 127.0.0.1 with any of the available ports ranging from 4501 - 4600.  The IP address used for binding has to be 127.0.0.1 and not localhost.
The applications that require access to MOSIP devices could discover them by sending the http request to the supported port range.

**_HTTP Request:_**

MOSIPDISC http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>/device
HOST: 127.0.0.1: <apps port>
EXT: <app name>

**_HTTP Response:_**

HTTP/1.1 200 ok
CACHE-CONTROL:no-store
LOCATION:http://127.0.0.1:<device_service_port>
Content-Length: length in bytes of the body
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed
Note: the pay loads are json in both the cases and are part of the body.
*callbackId would be set to the [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1):<device_service_port>. So, the caller will use the respective verb and the url to call the service.


**Android:**

All devices on an android device should listen to the following intent io.mosip.device
Upon invocation of this intent the devices are expected to respond back with the json response filtered by the respective type.
*callbackId would be set to the appId. So, the caller will create the intent appId.Info or appId.Capture


**IOS**:

All device on an IOS device would respond to the url schema as follows.

MOSIPDISC://<call-back-app-url>?ext=<caller app name>&type=<type as defined in mosip device request>

If a MOSIP compliant device service app exist then the url would launch the service. The service in return should respond back to the caller using the call-back-app-url with the base64 encoded json as the url parameter for the key data.


Note: In IOS there are restrictions to have multiple apps registering to the same URL schema.


*callbackId would be set to the device service appname. So, the caller has to call appnameInfo or appnameCapture as the url scheme.


#### Device Info:

The device information API would be used to identify the MOSIP compliant devices and their status by the applications.

Device Info Request:

**Request:**

NONE

**Accepted Values **

**Response:**

```

This in an index that always starts with 1 and increments sequentially.
```
**_Note_**: The response is an array that we could have a single device enumerating with multiple biometric options.
Note: The service should ensure to respond only if the type parameter matches the type of device or the type parameter is a “Biometric Device”.
