**Objective**
The objective of this specification document is to establish the technical and compliance standards/ protocols that are necessary for a biometric device to be used in MOSIP solutions.

**Target Audience**
This is a biometric device specification document and aims to help the biometric device manufactures, their developers, and their designers in building MOSIP compliant devices.
This document assumes that the readers are familiar with MOSIP registration and authentication services.

**MOSIP Devices**
All devices that collect biometric data for MOSIP should operate within the specification of this document.

* Auth - The process of verifying one’s identity.
* FPS - Frames Per Second

### Device Specification

The MOSIP device specification provides compliance guidelines to devices for them to work with MOSIP. The compliance is based device capability, trust and communication protocols. A MOSIP compliant device would follow the standards established in this document. A certification process will be established against this specification to test and validate the device compliance. The details of each of these are outlined in the subsequent sections.

**Device Capability:**
The MOSIP compliant device is expected to perform the following:
*   Should have the ability to collect one or more biometric
*   Should have the ability to sign the biometric image or template.
*   Should have the ability to protect against injection of biometric

[http://docs.oasis-open.org/bioserv/BIAS/v2.0/csprd01/schemas/cbeff_ed2.xsd](http://docs.oasis-open.org/bioserv/BIAS/v2.0/csprd01/schemas/cbeff_ed2.xsd)

We recommend that countries look at ergonomics, accessibility, ease of usage, and common availability of devices while choosing devices for use in registration and authentication scenarios.

### Device Trust

MOSIP compliant devices provide a trust environment for the devices to be used in registration, KYC and auth scenarios. The trust level is established based on the device support for trusted execution.

**Foundational Device Trust Module:**

The foundational device trust module would be created using a secure microprocessor capable of performing all required biometric processing and secure storage of keys. The foundational device trust would satisfy the below requirements.

1. The module has the ability to store/generate and process cryptographic keys.
2. Hardware based generation of asymmetric keys.
3. The module has the ability to protect keys from extraction.
4. The module has to protect the keys from physical tampering, temperature, frequency and voltage related attacks.
5. The module has the ability to perform a secure boot.
6. The module has the ability to run trusted applications.

The foundational device trust is derived from this module is used to enable trust-based computing for biometric capture.

The foundational device trust module provides for a trusted execution environment based on the following.

1. Secure Boot
    1. Ability to cryptographically verify code before execution.
    2. Ability to check for integrity violation of the module/device
    3. Halt upon failure.
1. Secure application
    1. Ability to run applications that are trusted.
    2. Protect against downgrading of applications.

**Foundational Trust Module Identity:**

The foundational module upon its first boot is expected to generate a random asymmetric key pair and provide the public part of the key to obtain a valid certificate. The entire certificate issuance would be in a secured provisioning facility. The certificate issued to the module will have a defined validity period as per the MOSIP certificate policy document.
